### Project Description
FurFolio is the ultimate lifestyle hub for cats, where our furry friends can pick hairstyles, choose costumes, write their diaries, and keep track of their very busy to-do lists.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Cats lead chaotic lives ‚Äî chasing laser dots, knocking over water glasses, and napping in 17 different places. Without proper organization and style options, how will they manage their schedules and look fabulous?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
FurFolio gives cats everything they never knew they needed: a digital space to choose hairstyles, plan their day, dress for success, and pen down their deepest meow-thoughts ‚Äî all in one purrfectly useless app.
